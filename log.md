# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jan 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setting myself up to learn coding by joining #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** I won't be able to work on any projects as such but I will follow skillshare classes and do exercises every day.

### Day 1: Jan 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises in my Skillshare class.

**Thoughts** I've only very recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally work out why something doesn't work the way I wanted it to or find a more elegant way of writing code.

### Day 2: Jan 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through some exercises in my Skillshare class.

**Thoughts** Not feeling super motivated today since I've already run a lot of errands and will have to leave in a few minutes again. Time is short today.

### Day 3: Jan 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've done exercises on skillshare about indexing.

**Thoughts** Kinda stressed out about the whole aspect of code every day, because I'm going to be travelling for the next few days and I'm not sure if I'll have the opportunity to take an hour to do so.

### Day 4: Jan 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've done exercises on skillshare about looping.

**Thoughts** Using crappy train Wi-Fi to keep up the streak. Internet has never been slower. I wanted to do looping and ranges and in more than one hour but the wifi simply wasn't good enough for video streaming.

### Day 5: Jan 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've revised a little bit and gone on to ranges

**Thoughts** Travel and being sick has made it impossible for me to keep my streak going. But I am determined to be back now. Finger's crossed, I won't fall ill again so soon.

### Day 6: Jan 24, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've made quite a bit of progress learning about objects, hashes and symbols

**Thoughts** For the first time, I've had the feeling that things are coming together a little bit. Classes were especially helpful, given that I've been trying to do things that require classes without actually knowing about them yet.
