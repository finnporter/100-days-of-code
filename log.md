# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jan 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setting myself up to learn coding by joining #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** I won't be able to work on any projects as such but I will follow skillshare classes and do exercises every day.

### Day 1: Jan 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises in my Skillshare class.

**Thoughts** I've only very recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally work out why something doesn't work the way I wanted it to or find a more elegant way of writing code.

### Day 2: Jan 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through some exercises in my Skillshare class.

**Thoughts** Not feeling super motivated today since I've already run a lot of errands and will have to leave in a few minutes again. Time is short today.
