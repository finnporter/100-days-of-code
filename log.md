# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 25: Mar 9, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Only one or so exercise, but I went to the Ruby meetup and learned a lot about how Brexit will affect digital laws and therefore developers

**Thoughts** TIL: we're fucked.

### Day 24: Mar 8, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Some progress with Vim. Not a lot of time today but at least a little bit of it.

**Thoughts** I'm highly motivated but didn't have so much time today.

### Day 23: Mar 7, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Command line. All of it. A whole day of command line.

**Thoughts** It's a good feeling to know something that is part of coding fairly well. I can use Terminal for a lot of things and those I can't I know how to look up. I feel very accomplished and ready to move on.

### Day 22: Mar 6, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I went through more Ruby the Hard Way exercises. A lot of them offline.

**Thoughts** I've been using my flashcards to learn commands the last few days but I didn't think to continue the log. So I will now blanket-continue it.

### Day 21: Feb 27, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Revising commandlines and playing around with them in Terminal to make sure they stick

**Thoughts** No thoughts, except that I feel like I'm making progress. And I'm contemplating doing a front end dev class next and put ruby on the back burner even though it's more fun.

### Day 20: Feb 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Wrote flashcards for command line

**Thoughts** Not much time to do anything but at least it was a little bit.

**Link(s)**


### Day 19: Feb 26, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Revising a little bit and learning more about Terminal/Command lines

**Thoughts** Forcing myself to take it slow is hard. But I can see that it works so I'll stick with it.

### Day 18: Feb 25, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Couldn't do anything yesterday because job search was prevalent. But today, I more than made up for it by doing 4 huge exercises.

**Thoughts** My head hurts. It's getting complicated and I should probably revise before moving on to the next part.

### Day 17: Feb 23, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Learn Ruby the hard way and did two exercises that were quite long. I'm also doing ex22 and ex23 but they don't have any code, so I won't upload anything.

**Thoughts** The trick really is to do a little bit each day. That way what I learn can settle and also, I don't get that feeling you get when you push something to the next day and the next and the next. When I study every day, that feeling of dread doesn't happen because I still remember how much fun it was yesterday. Somehow, I forget that when I take too much of a break.

### Day 16: Feb 22, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Learn Ruby the hard way and did two exercises.

**Thoughts** It seems I'm getting back into it. Those two exercises took me very long but I solved them. I only came up with 5 ways to write a function instead of 10. But I'm too hungry to go on and it's too late to go back to it later.

### Day 15: Feb 21, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Learn Ruby the hard way and did one exercise.

**Thoughts** I've hit a little bit of a slump because of other responsibilities but I'm confident I can come back to my coding regularly soon.

### Day 14: Feb 8, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Learn Ruby the hard way and did a few exercises.

**Thoughts** I've not been able to do one of the study drills. I've let it sit for a while and suddenly it was very clear to me. Unfortunately, it was a very long sitting period. But I really want to do exercises daily again.

### Day 13: Feb 1, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Learn Ruby the hard way and did a few exercises.

**Thoughts** I'm finally seeing the merits of moving so slowly through the exercises.

### Day 12: Jan 30, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Learn Ruby the hard way and did a few exercises.

**Thoughts** LRtHW is moving very slowly. But I reckon that's a good thing and I'm just being impatient.

### Day 11: Jan 29, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Doing the last of the skillshare class and then some research about Rails. Like Leila Hofer's video about MVC and Rails. Got started with Learn Ruby the Hard Way.

**Thoughts** Took a long walk in the cold today, so my frozen fingers don't like typing. But I'm glad I sat down to code anyways.

### Day 10: Jan 28, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: More Ruby Monk and some skillshare class afterward. inheritance.

**Thoughts** No particular thoughts.

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 9: Jan 27, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from Skillshare to try out Ruby Monk, beginners course, went through almost all of it

**Thoughts** Not sure how much I like Ruby Monk. It doesn't really explain a lot. Don't think that I would've understood much if it weren't for the skillshare class.

### Day 8: Jan 26, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Just a very short revision

**Thoughts** Didn't have much time doing anything today.

### Day 7: Jan 25, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Easy lesson today. Time and its methods, formats, strftime, etc.

**Thoughts** I started the day with an hour or so of ruby instead of work. nice change of pace.

### Day 6: Jan 24, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've made quite a bit of progress learning about objects, hashes and symbols

**Thoughts** For the first time, I've had the feeling that things are coming together a little bit. Classes were especially helpful, given that I've been trying to do things that require classes without actually knowing about them yet.

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 5: Jan 23, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've revised a little bit and gone on to ranges

**Thoughts** Travel and being sick has made it impossible for me to keep my streak going. But I am determined to be back now. Finger's crossed, I won't fall ill again so soon.

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 4: Jan 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've done exercises on skillshare about looping.

**Thoughts** Using crappy train Wi-Fi to keep up the streak. Internet has never been slower. I wanted to do looping and ranges and in more than one hour but the wifi simply wasn't good enough for video streaming.

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 3: Jan 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've done exercises on skillshare about indexing.

**Thoughts** Kinda stressed out about the whole aspect of code every day, because I'm going to be travelling for the next few days and I'm not sure if I'll have the opportunity to take an hour to do so. 

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 2: Jan 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through some exercises in my Skillshare class.

**Thoughts** Not feeling super motivated today since I've already run a lot of errands and will have to leave in a few minutes again. Time is short today. 

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 1: Jan 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises in my Skillshare class.

**Thoughts** I've only very recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally work out why something doesn't work the way I wanted it to or find a more elegant way of writing code.

**Link(s) to work**


### Day 0: Jan 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setting myself up to learn coding by joining #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** I won't be able to work on any projects as such but I will follow skillshare classes and do exercises every day.
