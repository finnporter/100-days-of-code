# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Jan 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Setting myself up to learn coding by joining #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** I won't be able to work on any projects as such but I will follow skillshare classes and do exercises every day.

### Day 1: Jan 9, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises in my Skillshare class.

**Thoughts** I've only very recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally work out why something doesn't work the way I wanted it to or find a more elegant way of writing code.

### Day 2: Jan 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through some exercises in my Skillshare class.

**Thoughts** Not feeling super motivated today since I've already run a lot of errands and will have to leave in a few minutes again. Time is short today.

### Day 3: Jan 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've done exercises on skillshare about indexing.

**Thoughts** Kinda stressed out about the whole aspect of code every day, because I'm going to be travelling for the next few days and I'm not sure if I'll have the opportunity to take an hour to do so.
