Dear Rus, my brother,
if you're reading this letter it means that you went through my things. And if
you went through my things, you're only doing it because I haven't come home.

Rus, I am part of the Resistance. We always meet at Gus' pub. Everything seems to be normal in Turuth, everyone
lives in harmony. But that's not true. Anyone who speaks up about the Principal
suddenly vanishes. Have you never wondered, why there are guards all around the dome walls?
What are they protecting? Nothing can come in, if there is really nothing but
toxic air and poisoned dirt out there. And who would go out?
They are sending people to prison for life for asking questions. Nobody has ever
been allowed to visit them. That's because they are killed. By the guards.

Brother, please don't come looking for me. My life is forfeited. I wanted you to
know the truth. But promise me, don't do anything. Stay where you are, get a job,
marry and have a good life. The Resistance is doomed.

With love,
Roy
