Welcome to Turuth! It's the year 2078.
Humanity has managed to ruin Earth but before they did, they managed to build 6 domes;
one on each continent.

Turuth is the biggest one of them, located on what they used
to call the African continent.

The domes are self-sufficient. The produce their own air, water and resources needed to survive.
The dome societies have managed to create a life better than before.

There is no pollution, there is no poverty, no inequality. People live
together in piece and harmony.
